# Module Purpose
**Goal:** Identify the paper’s main contributions/findings, list 3–5 key innovations, and link each contribution to specific sections.

# Inputs and Outputs
## Inputs
- Section texts: Introduction, Results, Discussion, Conclusion  
- Full paper if needed  

## Outputs
- 3–5 bullet points of contributions  
- Each contribution linked to originating sections  
- Brief evidence snippets per contribution  

# Step-by-Step Logic

## 1. Scan Core Sections
- **Targets:**  
  - Abstract  
  - Introduction (contribution statements)  
  - Methods (novelty)  
  - Results (performance)  
  - Discussion / Conclusion (implications)

## 2. Extract Candidate Claims
- **Criteria:** Novelty, empirical improvement, theoretical insight, dataset/tool release

## 3. Select Top 3–5 Contributions
- **Prioritization:** Uniqueness, measurable impact, clarity

## 4. Link to Sections
- **Mapping:** Associate each contribution with its originating section(s)

## 5. Render Bullets
- **Format:** Short, precise points  
- Include section linkage and minimal evidence phrase

# Error Handling Procedures
- **No explicit contributions:** Infer from results/methods; mark as *“implicit”* and add caution to warnings  
- **Conflicting claims:** Note ambiguity; avoid definitive statements  
- **Insufficient evidence:** Flag and use conservative phrasing
